start with: #!/bin/bash

$0: name of the bash script
$1-9: respective arguments taken in the command line
$#: number of command line arguments passed in
$@: all the arguments supplied to the script
$?: exit status of the most recent process
$$: process ID of the current script
$USER: username of the user running the script
$HOSTNAME: name of machine running the script
$SECONDS: the number of seconds since the script was started
$RANDOM: random number generated
$LINENO: returns the current line number in the bash script

print to screen: echo ....
		print variable to screen: $variable

variables: *variable_name*=*variable_value*
	ex. myVar=Hello
	ex. var1=/etc
	ex. a=1
	ex. str='hello $x' -> has the actual value of: hello $x
	ex. str2="hello $x' -> has the actual value of: hello *x*
to make something into a variable: var=$( ls ) , for example, works. Converts to a variable

operations on variables:

sum: $((a+b)) or $[a+b]

write over a varible: echo a > b -> write the value of b over a

write to file: echo "into file" > file.txt



--------------------------------------------------

logic statements:


test *test* -> gives the value of 0/1 respectively to ?





if [ *test* ]
then
*operation to perform*
elif [ *test* ]
then
*operation to perform*
else
*operation to perform*
fi

or

if [ *test* ]; then *operation to perform*; *second operation*; *third operation*; fi


operators:      lt: less than
	   	gt: greater than
	   	eq: equal to
	   	=: equivalent strings
		!=: not equivalent strings
		!: false expression
		-n: length of string > 0
		-z: length of string = 0
		-d: exists and is directory
		-e: exists
		-r: exists and read permission
		-s: file exists and is not empty
		-w: file exists and write permission
		-x: file exists and execute permission



--------------------------------------------------

loops:

for: for((i=1;i<=7;i++)); do
	echo i=$i
     done



--------------------------------------------------

reading/writing files


writing data to a file:

echo "a=$a" >> *file* -> appends a=*value of a* to *file*	



writing files and text input to file:

cat > *file* -> enter what is desired to be entered into the file then press ctrl+d

cat *file1* > *file2* -> puts the data in *file1* into *file2*

cat *file1* *file2* -> copy the files

cat > *file* -> create a file

cat *file1* >> *file2* -> appends *file2* with the contents of *file1*

cat - - >> *file* -> append *file* with two entries from two entries followed each by ctrl+d







--------------------------------------------------


anything to run in the bash terminal works in bash script
